# ZLOGG3R

Hello everyone, before going over our new application, let me just give you the background of this project. ZL0gg3r was part of my College Research Project. The project was just to create a simple Keylogger which is easy to create with Python, but I decided to challenge myself and create it with C# as I started using it recently. I mentioned the Key Logger idea to one of my friends, and he told me, why not make it even more than just a Keylogger. Which is the reason why we created this tool. So we are going to add more features that will make it go beyond a typical Keylogger.

You can read more about the Project below, it aslo include the installation guide:
